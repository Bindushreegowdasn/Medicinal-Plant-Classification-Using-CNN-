# 🌿 Medicinal Plant Classification using CNN

Medicinal plants play a major role in traditional healthcare systems. Identifying these plants manually requires expert knowledge and more time. This project provides an automated solution using a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** model to classify medicinal plants based on their leaf images. The model is trained on a dataset collected from Kaggle and can predict plant species with high accuracy.
